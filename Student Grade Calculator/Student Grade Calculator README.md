<h1 align="center">Student Grade Calculator</h1>
  
It is a simple Java program which takes marks of various subjects as input and that o calculate their Total marks and Average from which it calculates the overall grade based on predetermined weightings.


Here I have set the range for Grades as

      -------------------------------------
      |       Range         |    Grade    |
      |---------------------|-------------|
      |  Marks >= 90        |    'O'      |
      |  90 < Marks >= 80   |    'A+'     |
      |  80 < Marks >= 70   |    'A'      |
      |  70 < Marks >= 60   |    'B+'     |
      |  60 < Marks >= 50   |    'B'      |
      |  Marks > 50         |    'RA'     |
      |-----------------------------------|
